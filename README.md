# Fast Company

My fundamental React educational project based on React JS technology uses functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, customHooks, HOCs, Redux Toolkit, Firebase backend, Axios, npm plugins, and libraries). The project has implemented filtering, sorting, pagination, searching, logIn, SignUp, logOut and other features.
