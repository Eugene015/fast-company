# Fast Company

My fundamental React educational project based on React JS technology uses functional components and hooks (useState, useEffect, customHooks, HOCs, Redux Toolkit, Axios, npm plugins, and libraries). On backend there are NodeJS, Express and MongoDB. The project has implemented filtering, sorting, pagination, searching, logIn, SignUp, logOut, routing to multiple pages and other features.
